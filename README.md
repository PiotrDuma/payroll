# payroll
Payroll is an implementation of payment system in Java/Spring enviroment based on requirements' stories, UML diagrams and design patterns dercribed by Robert C. Martin in one of his book [[1]](#book-reference). A large amount of abstraction, polimorphism and SOLID priciples make system's architecture more flexible for extensions and keep code clean and simple. The design, originally written in C++, required a few modifications to be adjusted into Spring web application. The changes are describeed in the [modifications'](#modifications) and [conclusions'](#conclusions) sections.

## Run project

Make sure you have installed [git](https://git-scm.com/), [Java17 JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html) and [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi). You have to make them recognized in your system variables.

1. Download project from repository 
```
git clone https://github.com/PiotrDuma/payroll.git
```
2. Move to project folder
```
cd payroll
```
3. Build project with Maven
```
mvn clean install 
```
4. Run application in your command window
```
java -jar target/payroll-SNAPSHOT_1.0.jar
```

## Modifications

The main changes were caused by differences between C++ and Java. The Spring weeb application architecture required to provide higher lever of encapsulation, new design patterns and implementation of infrastructure and controller layers. 

+ avoidance of public classes, lack of pointers and global variables forced to change Transaction command interface to provide ID identifiers or final objects;
+ Union Affiliation has been excluded from Employee and implemented as independent domain with ability to create many instances and changing dues using different entry point;
+ Payday Transaction is a new service aggregating required elements across domains;
+ every Change Employee Transaction is placed in separated class provided by factory;
